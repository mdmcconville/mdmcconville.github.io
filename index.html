		</div>
		<p class="center">
		I&rsquo;m a software developer in Orange County, CA. I&rsquo;m originally from Santa Rosa, CA. I graduated from Minnesota State University Moorhead with a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. <em>Why Minnesota?</em> I felt that it would be good for me to venture outside of my comfort zone by living somewhere dramatically different. My idea worked and - at the very least - I don&rsquo;t really consider anything under 30 degrees Fahrenheit to be truly cold anymore.

		My immediate career goals revolve around refining my skills and gaining a depth of understanding along with breadth. I&rsquo;m also trying to learn things that are new to me such as web and mobile development. I may rarely use these things, but there is value in having experience in multiple areas. I'm particularly interested in building distributed applications.
		</p>
		<p class="center" style="margin-bottom:50px">
		A majority of my experience is using C#, C++, Python, and SQL variants. At work I typically use C#, Perl, MySQL, MSSQL, and whatever else is necessary. For personal projects, I tend to lean toward using Python and C++. They were the first languages that I learned, but I&rsquo;ve found Python to be useful for prototyping quickly.
